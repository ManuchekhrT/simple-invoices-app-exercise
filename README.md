# simple-invoices-app-exercise
## App requirements done:
- Handled loading, error, and empty states
- Display name, quantity and amount per line item. Display total and date per invoice 
- Bonus - Build Invoice details screen when invoice item is clicked from the list 
- Upload project into Github

## Process:
- Clean Architecture, MVVM: Recommended way of writing and structuring your code for cases like testability, maintanability, flexibility, reusability, scalability
- The trade offs I made: Performance, Usability, Features
- To run the project: 
  * you need open Android Studio and select the project you want to run 
  * Once the project is loaded, select the device or emulator on which you want to run the project. 
  * Click on the "Run" button (green triangle) in the toolbar or go to Run > Run 'app' to build and run the project on the selected device or emulator.
  * Need to wait a little while for the Gradle build process to finish 
- Technology used: AndroidX Components, Timber (for debugging), Retrofit, OkHttp Logging, Dagger 2 - Hilt, Navigation Components, Lifecycle VM&Runtime&LiveData
